## B) Review Process

### Step 1: Iteration 1

**Prompt sent:**
> Custom mechanics for this set:
> 
> **Salvage X** (keyword_ability)
> Reminder text: (Look at the top X cards of your library. You may put an artifact card from among them into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.)
> Scaling: 2-3 at common, 4-5 at uncommon, 6+ at rare/mythic.
> Colors: W, U, G. Complexity: 1 (common-viable).
> 
> **Malfunction N** (keyword_ability)
> Reminder text: (This permanent enters tapped with N malfunction counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a malfunction counter from it.)
> Scaling: 1 at common, 2 at uncommon, 2-3 at rare/mythic.
> Colors: W, U, R. Complexity: 2.
> Design note: Enters tapped is the key tempo cost. Cards with malfunction are intentionally above-rate for their mana cost.
> 
> **Overclock** (keyword_action)
> Reminder text: (Exile the top three cards of your library. You may play them until end of turn.)
> Colors: U, R, B. Complexity: 3 (uncommon+ only, never at common).
> Design note: High risk/reward. Always exiles exactly 3 cards.
> 
> Card to review:
> Name: Subsurface Expedition Leader
> Mana Cost: {2}{W}{W}
> Type: Creature â€” Human Soldier
> Rarity: rare
> Oracle Text: When ~ enters, salvage 6.
> {2}{W}, {T}: Salvage 3. Activate only as a sorcery.
> P/T: 3/4
> Flavor Text: "Every expedition needs someone willing to go first into the dark. The job has remarkably high turnover."
> 
> Critically review this card and provide an improved version based on your findings. If the card is fine, return it unchanged with verdict OK.

**Tool call result:**
```json
{
  "changed": true,
  "verdict": "REVISED",
  "issues_found": [
    "Salvage 6 on ETB is specified as rare/mythic scaling (6+), which is fine for a rare card. However, the activated ability uses Salvage 3, which falls in the common scaling range (2-3). For a rare card with an activated ability costing {2}{W} and a tap, Salvage 3 feels underwhelming and mismatched with the card's rarity. Bumping to Salvage 4 aligns with uncommon+ scaling and better fits the rare power level and activation cost.",
    "The sorcery-speed restriction on the activated ability is a good design choice for repeated Salvage, keeping gameplay clean. No issue here.",
    "Stats (3/4 for 4 mana) are reasonable for a rare with significant value abilities. No issue.",
    "Flavor text is charming and fits the expedition theme well. No issue."
