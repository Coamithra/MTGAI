## B) Review Process

### Step 1: Iteration 1

**Prompt sent:**
> Custom mechanics for this set:
> 
> **Salvage X** (keyword_ability)
> Reminder text: (Look at the top X cards of your library. You may put an artifact card from among them into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.)
> Scaling: 2-3 at common, 4-5 at uncommon, 6+ at rare/mythic.
> Colors: W, U, G. Complexity: 1 (common-viable).
> 
> **Malfunction N** (keyword_ability)
> Reminder text: (This permanent enters tapped with N malfunction counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a malfunction counter from it.)
> Scaling: 1 at common, 2 at uncommon, 2-3 at rare/mythic.
> Colors: W, U, R. Complexity: 2.
> Design note: Enters tapped is the key tempo cost. Cards with malfunction are intentionally above-rate for their mana cost.
> 
> **Overclock** (keyword_action)
> Reminder text: (Exile the top three cards of your library. You may play them until end of turn.)
> Colors: U, R, B. Complexity: 3 (uncommon+ only, never at common).
> Design note: High risk/reward. Always exiles exactly 3 cards.
> 
> Card to review:
> Name: Synaptic Overload
> Mana Cost: {1}{U}
> Type: Instant
> Rarity: uncommon
> Oracle Text: As an additional cost to cast ~, overclock. (Exile the top three cards of your library. You may play them until end of turn.)
> Counter target spell. If you overclocked this turn, draw a card.
> Flavor Text: "The prototype neural interface worked perfectly. The subject's brain, however, did not." ï¿½Dr. Malleus, Cult of Science
> 
> Critically review this card and provide an improved version based on your findings. If the card is fine, return it unchanged with verdict OK.

**Tool call result:**

{
  "changed": true,
  "verdict": "REVISED",
  "issues_found": [
    "Overclock mechanic is being misused - it's a keyword action that should happen when the spell resolves, not as an additional cost",
    "The conditional 'If you overclocked this turn' doesn't work properly since overclock would happen as part of casting",
    "Card advantage is too high for 2 mana - countering a spell AND drawing a card AND getting access to 3 exiled cards",
    "Flavor text has encoding issue with special character"
  ],
  "name": "Synaptic Overload",
  "mana_cost": "{1}{U}{U}",
