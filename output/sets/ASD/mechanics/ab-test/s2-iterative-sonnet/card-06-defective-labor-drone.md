## B) Review Process

### Step 1: Iteration 1

**Prompt sent:**
> Custom mechanics for this set:
> 
> **Salvage X** (keyword_ability)
> Reminder text: (Look at the top X cards of your library. You may put an artifact card from among them into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.)
> Scaling: 2-3 at common, 4-5 at uncommon, 6+ at rare/mythic.
> Colors: W, U, G. Complexity: 1 (common-viable).
> 
> **Malfunction N** (keyword_ability)
> Reminder text: (This permanent enters tapped with N malfunction counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a malfunction counter from it.)
> Scaling: 1 at common, 2 at uncommon, 2-3 at rare/mythic.
> Colors: W, U, R. Complexity: 2.
> Design note: Enters tapped is the key tempo cost. Cards with malfunction are intentionally above-rate for their mana cost.
> 
> **Overclock** (keyword_action)
> Reminder text: (Exile the top three cards of your library. You may play them until end of turn.)
> Colors: U, R, B. Complexity: 3 (uncommon+ only, never at common).
> Design note: High risk/reward. Always exiles exactly 3 cards.
> 
> Card to review:
> Name: Defective Labor Drone
> Mana Cost: {1}{W}
> Type: Artifact Creature â€” Automaton
> Rarity: common
> Oracle Text: Malfunction 1 (This permanent enters tapped with 1 malfunction counter on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a malfunction counter from it.)
> P/T: 3/2
> Flavor Text: "It keeps trying to mine the ceiling. We've explained gravity to it seventeen times." â€”Foreman Krix
> 
> Critically review this card and provide an improved version based on your findings. If the card is fine, return it unchanged with verdict OK.

However, a vanilla 3/2 for {1}{W} with only Malfunction 1 (i.e., only tapped for one turn) is arguably too strong even with the drawback. A {1}{W} creature is typically a 2/2 or 2/1 at common. With Malfunction 1 (only one missed attack/block), a 3/2 body is extremely pushed \u2014 this is a Savannah Lions that's just tapped on entry. Consider reducing to 3/1 or 2/2 to preserve balance without neutering the mechanic showcase.\", \"Oracle text: Reminder text is present and correctly matches the Malfunction mechanic definition \u2014 OK.\"]",
